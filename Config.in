	help
	  Threshold that configures the switch of quick sort to insertion sort.
	  For each partition, when the number of elements left to sort is below

config STROLL_ARRAY_MERGE_SORT_FULL_RUNS
	bool "Merge sort full runs optimization"
	depends on STROLL_ARRAY_MERGE_SORT
	default y
	help
	  This optimization gives merge sort the ability to detect fully ordered
	  partitions in order to skip the usual partitions / sub-arrays merging
	  process at the expense of 2 additional array element comparisons.
	  This may improve performances for partially / fully ordered data sets.

config STROLL_ARRAY_MERGE_SORT_RUNS_BYBLOCK
	bool "Merge sort runs by block optimization"
	depends on STROLL_ARRAY_MERGE_SORT
	default y
	help
	  This optimization gives merge sort the ability to try to merge
	  partitions / sub-arrays by blocks of consecutive ordered elements as
	  opposed to the traditional single element based merging process.
	  This allows to replace multiple primary element copy operations
	  by one single copy of a block of ordered primary elements.
	  This may improve performances for partially / fully ordered data sets.
